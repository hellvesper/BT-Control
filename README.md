This is simple Bluetooth CRSF receiver to control Flight Controllers with regular bluetooth gamepads, it based on bluepad32 and btstack and partly on betaflight code for CRSF protocol.

Note: ESP32S3 support only BLE gamepads, for example DualSense doesn't support BLE and don't with ESP32S3, look at espressif docs and bluepad32 project for supported hardware.
